# wskgitapp

A VA Smalltalk wrapper for git commands.

# Why?
* To have a workflow with the ability to view and edit Smalltalk without a Smalltalk IDE. For example reviewing code changes could be done using standard Gitlab/Github functionality. Audits can be done by non-programmers.
* To integrate documentation and project tasks in a single repository. Using md files documentation is automatically published on Gitlab/Github and we can easily link changes to an issue tracker.
* To use a git repository to control the CI/CD pipeline. 
* To have a single repository for the whole project including both Smalltalk and non-Smalltalk resources.

# Installing
