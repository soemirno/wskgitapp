# wskgitapp

A VA Smalltalk wrapper for git commands.

# Why?
* To have a workflow with the ability to view and edit Smalltalk without a Smalltalk IDE. For example reviewing code changes could be done using standard gitlab/github functionality.  
* To integrate documentation and project tasks in a single repository. Using md files it is automatically published on Gitlab/Github.
* To use a git repository to control the CI/CD pipeline. 

# Installing
Clone this reposistory locally and use tonel to load the applications.
